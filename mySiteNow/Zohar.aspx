            <p>Zohar Argov was born in Rishon LeZion, Israel, to Ovadia and Yona Orkabi, Jewish parents who immigrated from Yemen. He was the eldest of ten children. He displayed a talent for singing in childhood, and his classmates nicknamed him "nightingale". All his siblings also displayed an interest in music. As a result of Argov's disinterest in any aspect of school except music, which was exacerbated by his family's financial problems, he dropped out of school at age 14 to work at a construction company. In 1972, he married a neighbour, Bracha Tzabari, and a year later, she gave birth to their son Gili. Argov's father Ovadia, with whom he had had a stormy relationship over the latter's authoritarianism and alcoholism, died on the day of Gili's bris. Gili would later follow in his footsteps and become a singer as well. Due to his family situation, he was exempted from mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces. </p>

            <p>In 1977, at age 22, Argov published a single with two songs written and composed by Moshe Nagar. When releasing this single, in consultation with his wife Bracha, he changed his last name from Orkabi to Argov. He felt that the name Orkabi would not "sound good" to the media and establishment, and chose the name of one of the greatest composers and musicians in Israel at the time, Sasha Argov.
                The single was unsuccessful, later, in 1981' his album "Elinor" which featured the title track, "Sod HaMazalot" ("The Zodiac Secret"), and "Mah Lakh, Yaldah?" ("What's With You, Girl?"), a tribute to his ex-wife, Bracha, who remained the love of his life.
                With the success of the album, Argov became a popular singer, and performed live throughout Israel. He was among the first singers to achieve commercial and nationwide success in the sphere of Middle Eastern-Mediterranean/Oriental (Mizrahi)-style music, despite the fact that his music was not mainstream at the time and radio stations gave predominance to pop music from overseas.
                In 1982, Argov toured the United States, and was invited to parties and clubs. It was there that he was first exposed to hard drugs and began to develop his heroin and crack cocaine addiction.</p>

        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>In the early morning hours of July 23, 1987, Argov, his brother, and another man entered the Magen David Adom station in Rishon LeZion and demanded drugs. Shortly afterward, Argov was arrested on suspicion of stealing the purse of a doctor in the area, but was released after it was determined he had nothing to do with the theft. During his release from the police station, Argov stole a pistol that was lying on a desk. After an extensive manhunt, he was arrested with the pistol in his possession, convicted, and sentenced to one month in prison, which was extended to six months upon appeal.

Three weeks before he was due to be released, Argov was granted a furlough to allow him to go home. He initially stayed in the home of singer Yishai Levi in Holon before he and Levi's girlfriend and future wife, Iris Gabbay, stayed alone at Argov's mother's house in Rishon LeZion. Afterwards, Gabbay filed a police complaint claiming that Argov had attempted to rape her. Upon returning to prison, Argov was arrested and taken to a police station in Rishon LeZion for interrogation.

On November 6, 1987, Argov died in his cell in an apparent suicide by hanging. He was 32.

After his death Argov continued to retain his status as "HaMelekh" (the King) of Mizrahi music. From 1990, three years after his death, the Israel Broadcasting Authority organized a series of annual memorial concerts at Binyanei HaUma convention center in Jerusalem and a fundraising campaign was launched to establish a drug rehabilitation center named after him. He is credited with introducing Mizrahi music into the Israeli mainstream, and his life story has been widely discussed, with some considering it emblematic of the sociocultural tragedy that befalls singers from the Mizrahi community in Israel.
